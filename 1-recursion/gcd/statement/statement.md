# Greatest Common Divisor

## Description

You are given two integers $A, B$.
Please find their greatest common divisor $d=\gcd(A, B)$, and also, find some integers $x, y$ so that $Ax+By = d$.

## Input

Two integers $A, B$.

## Output

Three integers $d, x, y$.

## Technical Specifications

* It is guaranteed that $1\le A, B\le 10^9$.
* Your output should satisfy $0\le |x|, |y| \le 10^9$.

## Scoring

* If you only get $d$ correct, you'll get 40% score of each test case.
* If you get $x, y$ correct, and also $d$ correct, then you'll get full score.
